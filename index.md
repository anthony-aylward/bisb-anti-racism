# Anti-racist action items for BISB

## I. From the grad division

The grad division now encourages grad programs to elimenate the GRE etc. as a requirement for admission. Per a recent email from the dean:

> We will encourage graduate programs to eliminate standardized test scores as a requirement for admission and will assist those programs that wish to eliminate the testing requirement in gaining the necessary approval to do so.

## II. From the graduate student association

The GSA has defined [several calls to action](Commitment-and-call-to-action.pdf) at the department/program level:

> - Check in on your graduate students and create a safe space for these conversations. Many students feel uncomfortable bringing these issues into “professional training” environments, but these are precisely the places we must be talking.
> - Recognize that your students, your teaching assistants,and your researchers are struggling with these events. Grant them compassion and leniency to enable their academic success in this time of great distress.
> - Demand and, when possible, create stronger and more effective systems of accountability for protection of students in a system that resists accountability and dehumanizes graduate students for their labor. This includes providing mentees opportunities to evaluate their mentors and programs and providing anonymous reporting systems to address student concerns.
> - Demand and, when possible by those qualified, create better diversity and mentorship training from the University for all faculty to identify and prevent policies and actions causing harm to your students.
> - Advocate for a revision of the Academic Review tenure process to include a fourth item encompassing EDI efforts by each faculty member that is weighted equivalently to the existing three of research, teaching, and university/public service.
> - Re-evaluate the purpose and structure of UC San Diego’s Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion requirements and pedagogies to ensure that courses are effective, meaningful, and up-to-date with recent events.

## III. From BISB students

### Town hall items

BISB students have proposed several action items to address issues discussed
in the recent town hall meeting:

> 1. Create clear program guidelines for anonymous reporting of complaints or conflict
> 2. Introduce diversity and inclusion sensitivity training for all program faculty, students, and staff (i.e. similar to the Ethics training required by NIH Guidelines)
> 3. Implement program-organized BISB & BMI community events to foster cross-cultural exchange
> 4. Provide financial incentives for URM individuals (e.g., removing GRE requirements, fee waivers)

### Program handbook

Additionally, a response from a [recent student survey](20200211_MR_WI20-Steering-Committee-Student-Comments-2.pdf) suggested creating a
program handbook in PDF format:

> One student commented on the lack of a physical PDF for program guidelines that
students can easily access. Only having a website to serve as a program resource is frustrating to students, as this can be easily modified by program faculty without the oversight of version control.
> - For example, program guidelines [in PDF] are easily available to graduate students in BMS and Biology.
> -  This individual asked for a document-controlled resource for students and faculty that would provide expectations of the program for each stakeholder

Such a handbook could provide clear and explicit guidelines on:
- anti-racist conduct
- response to racial or gender discrimination
- anonymous reporting
- time spent on coursework vs. research

### Mental Health

Take advantage of available resources to improve mental health support. Mental health issues affect BISB students and disproportionately affect marginalized students. Some resources:
  - [Dr. Rob Knight's mental health talk](bioengineering_faculty_spotlight_jan_29.pdf)
  - [Dragonfly Mental Health](http://dragonflymentalhealth.com)
  - [Mental Health in Academia: How to enact change](https://elifesciences.org/interviews/49454377/wendy-marie-ingram)
  - [PhD Balance](https://www.phdbalance.com)
  - [Mental Health in Academia: How Departments Can Support Faculty, Staff, and Students](https://ideasonfire.net/mental-health-in-academia/)
  - [Background on mental health at UCSD](https://anthony-aylward.github.io/mental-health/)

### Financial support

Increase stipend/financial support, _at least_ for URM students. Low stipends are a barrier to entry for BIPOC applicants. Lobby for removal of bureaucratic barriers if necessary. For example: BISB student Jens Luebeck wrote a [letter](NIH-trainee-stipend-cap.pdf) to NIH director Francis Collins urging him to raise the NIH predoctoral trainee stipend cap, and encouraged other students to do the same.

### Administration

As soon as possible, hire at least two permanent coordinators. Reliable admin resources are required to ensure all students are well-supported, and when they fall short it is especially BIPOC students who suffer.

Some students have drawn attention to [a recent opinion piece by Dr. Akiko Iwasaki](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0831-6) (see also the [supplementary materials](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-020-0831-6/MediaObjects/41591_2020_831_MOESM1_ESM.pdf)) in which she offers suggestions for improving accountability in graduate programs. Some of these policies could benefit BISB.

### Student participation

Students are eager to support program directors in their efforts to improve the program. To that end, it would be useful for students and directors to have conversations about:
- With whom do the directors negotiate the conditions of the program?
- What are the obstacles to student funding, admin hiring, etc?
- How can students support the directors in pressuring / lobbying other parties?
